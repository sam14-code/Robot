# Robot API

This is a fully functional API to execute/run robot operations and save the operation instructions into a json file and later replay the interactions. 

Solution also includes a console test app and Unittests Project

When Console App is run, you can see robot instructions will be saved to a json file "C:\Test\RobotInstructions.json". Later same file will be read 
and instructions are replayed by the robot in original order. 

Note: Expection handling hasn't been implemented due to time constraint.
